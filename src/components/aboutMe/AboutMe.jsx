      <p>Hello! My name is Kevin Ma, and I am passionate and driven about learning and creating all things related to tech, 
        with a current focus on front-end web development and backend unit integration testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first programming experience came from high school, in which I took a computer science course that revolved around NetLogo. I recall being enamored by the endless possibilities and the puzzle-like magical code one had to peice together, like casting a magic spell that suddenly made a bunch of turtle and polygons take shape and action.
        However, I was intimidated by my peers who had the innate aptitude or intellect for programming as they created wildly fantastical worlds and proejcts I never thought possible.
        Meanwhile, I found writing a simple recursive function difficult. Although I enjoyed the challenge, and the jolt of euphoria when one finally makes that one bug go away or make that one function work properly, I simply held the thought that 'I wasn't good enough'.
      </p>
      <p>So I went to college and graduate school at SUNY Binghamton. Got a Master's in Accounting degree and became a licensed CPA. Worked for mid-size and Big 4 accounting firms, and volunteered for the IRS.</p>
      <p>But it felt empty.</p>
      <p>It was the safe path to a stable life my parents wanted for me, but I felt like I was a zombie; mindlessly wandering through life on a predetermined track, just half-living. Literally. Half the year - October through April - I worked 80-100 hour weeks and the other half I did barely 20 hours.</p>
      <p>And one day I really thought to myself what was it that I used to do that made me feel happy? Happy to progress and learn with an eagerness to face new problems and challenges?</p>
      <p>With the support of my invaluable friends and family I quit my old job and am now on my journey to becoming a full fledged Software Engineer, hoping to learn new skills in order to create solutions, websites, and applications that can benefit those people around me.</p>
      <p>I started this transition on March 31, 2022</p>
      <p>Since then I have completed the Flation School Softwa Engineering BootCamp and have learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript(ES6+)</li>
        <li>Data Structures and Algorithms in Python</li>
        <li>RESTful APIs using Ruby on Rails</li>
        <li>Dynamic Front-end Web Apps with React.js and Redux</li>
        <li>DRY and SOLID principles</li>
        <li>MVC (Model View Controller) Framework</li>
        <li>SQL and PostgreSQL</li>

      </ul>
